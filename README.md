# HaNNA (Halide Neural Network Acceleration)
Implement and investigate potential performance gain by implementing deep learning kernels with Halide
## Milestones
1. Implement typical deep learning kernels with Halide
  * At this stage we do not care too much about proper scheduling
2. Implement simple VGG16 network with Halide kernels
3. Investigate proper way to properly schedule kernels on GPU
  * we will be focusing on Nvidia GPU
4. Implement other Network and investigate potential ways of auto scheduling
